<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shish tawooks are tasty grilled chicken skewers that are served in every restaurant in the Middle East. You can easily make them at home and they'll taste just as good, if not better! Don't be tempted to substitute sour cream for the yogurt, as the yogurt works as a meat tenderizer.
